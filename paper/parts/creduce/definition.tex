For D-reducibility we required that every ring coloring could be flipped with Kempe-chains, to a coloring of $\overline{\Phi}(\confg)$. However, if this is not the case, we must try to avoid the bad colorings. We introduced reducers in Section \ref{sec:ringreduce} for exactly this purpose and will now introduce them more generally. 

\subsection{Definition with Bernhart's Diamond}

We will be working with an example as we develop this theory. This example is a relative of the Birkhoff Diamond ($
\bir$), called the Bernhart Diamond ($\ber$). First proven to be reducible by Arthur Frederick Bernhart in 1947 \cite{bernhart}.

    \label{fig:diamondbernhart}
\end{figure}

The core of $\ber$ as highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:diamondbernhart} can be found as a configuration in a list by Frank Allaire et al. \cite{frankallaire}. As you can see, two vertices of $\ber$ require 6 edges in $\confg$, as opposed to 5 in $\bir$. This is their only difference. We will follow the same procedure as we did for $\bir$ by analyzing all compatible colorings. The ring of size 8 has 274 unique colorings, in addition the max-implying set $\overline{\Phi}(\ber)$ has 92 colorings. Therefore, $\ber$ is not D-reducible. See the green and blue colored cells in Figure \ref{table:bernhart}.

\input{parts/creduce/bernhart_table.tex}

\needspace{10cm}
The blue colorings in this table are generated by the reducer of $\ber$. This reducer restricts which colorings can occur on the ring, in the same way that we did for the ring $R_5$ in Section \ref{sec:ringreduce}. The key property of a reducer is that its ring colorings can be converted to the original configuration through a mapping. To obtain this mapping, we  construct a reducer from its configuration $\confg$ in two steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Contract using $\sigma$, any non-neighboring vertices of the ring $R$ to a single point. Two contracted vertices will be colored the same. The result is the contracted ring $\sigma(R)$.
    \item Turn the contracted ring $\sigma(R)$ into the graph $S$ by including extra edges and vertices on the interior. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The exact definition of a contraction maps the vertices of $R$ to the vertices of $\sigma(R)$. Those vertices that are mapped to the same vertex are contracted. This mapping allows us to directly convert a ring coloring $x(u)$ of $S$ to a ring coloring $x(\sigma(v))$ of $R$.

\begin{definition}
    A ring contraction $\sigma(v)$ on $R$ is a map from $R$ to the contracted ring $\sigma(R)$. Neighboring vertices of $R$ may not be mapped to the same vertex by $\sigma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A reducer $(S,\sigma)$ of a configuration $\confg$ consists of
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A contraction $\sigma(v)$ on $R$.
        \item A graph $|S| < |\confg|$ whose boundary is the contracted ring $\sigma(R)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $(S, \sigma)$ be a reducer. The set of generated ring colorings $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ consists of all the colorings $x(\sigma(v))$ with $x(u)$ a boundary coloring of $S$.
\end{definition}


The reducer for $\ber$ is given in Figure \ref{fig:bernhart_reducer}. It consists of two contractions and a single extra edge added by $S$ in the middle. The mapping of colorings from $S$ to $R_8$ are given below. All the blue colorings found in Figure \ref{table:bernhart} satisfy $v_2 =v_4 \neq v_6 = v_8$. The reducer simply eliminates colorings without this property.

\begin{equation}
    v_1\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{2}\;v_3\;v_5\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{1}\;v_7 \quad\mapsto \quad v_1\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{2}\;v_3\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{2}\;v_5\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{1}\;v_7\;\textbf{u}_\textbf{1}.

\end{figure}

In the next section we will show that the red generated colorings in Figure \ref{table:bernhart} are actually in $\maxi{\ber}$, therefore $\Phi(S,\sigma) \subset \maxi{\ber}$. As a result, we may replace $\ber$ by its reducer $S$ and be guaranteed that any coloring for $S$ can be reversed to a compatible coloring of $\ber$. This is the essence of C-reducibility.
\begin{definition}
    A configuration $\confg$ is C-reducible if $\Phi(S,\sigma) \subset \overline{\Phi}(\confg)$ for some reducer $(S,\sigma)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

        \draw (0, 0) ellipse (3cm and 1.8cm);
        \draw (0, -0.3) ellipse (2cm and 1.2cm);
        \draw[fill opacity=0.4, pattern=north east lines] (0.8, -0.6) ellipse (0.8cm and 0.6cm);
        \draw[dotted, thick] (-0.7, -0.4) ellipse (1.0cm and 0.6cm);

        \node at (0.9, -0.6) { $\Phi_0(\confg)$ };
        \node at (0.3, 0.35) { $\overline{\Phi}(\confg)$ };
        \node at (0, 1.35) { $\Phi(n)$ };
        \node at (-0.8, -0.4) { $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ };
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \caption{The max-implying set includes all generated colorings of $\Phi(S,\sigma)$.  }
    \label{fig:cred}
\end{figure}

For any given configuration, there are only a finite number of reducers $(S,\sigma)$ possible. Therefore, it is feasible to simply test all possible reducers for the condition $\Phi(S,\sigma) \subset \maxi{\confg}$. This makes C-reducibility a powerful fallback option if there is no D-reducibility. C-reducibility is in fact a generalisation of D-reducibility. If we do not perform any contraction by setting $\sigma_{id}(v)=v$ and let $S=R$, then the condition for C-reducibility becomes

\begin{equation}
    \Phi(R,\sigma_{id}) \subset \maxi{\confg}\quad\implies\quad \Phi(R) = \maxi{\confg}.
\end{equation}

Therefore, C-reducibility extends upon D-reducibility, which extends upon $k$-reducibiliy.
