\subsection{Fundaments of the four color theorem}

The proof of the four color theorem follows the same structure as the five color theorem. We show that every planar graph contains a subgraph that allows us to reduce the coloring problem to a smaller graph. This notion of a \textit{subgraph} of a graph requires some extra attention, since there are multiple ways to be a subgraph.

Given a subgraph $\confg$ of a planar graph $G$. There are roughly two ways that $\confg$ can be a subgraph of $G$. See Figure \ref{fig:containtut}.

\begin{definition}
    A planar graph $\confg$ is \emph{contained} in a graph $G$ if no vertices of $G$ are in the interior of $\confg$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A planar graph $\confg$ is \emph{reducible} in a graph $G$ if $\confg$ being contained in $G$ implies that the 4-coloring of $G$ can be reduced to the 4-coloring of $G'$ with less vertices. $\confg$ is called a \emph{configuration}.
\end{definition}

Using these two definitions we can formulate the key theorem of the four color theorem. It simply states that every planar graph has a part that can be removed and recolored later, similar to how we did for the five color theorem.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{funda1}
    Every planar graph $G$ contains a configuration $\confg$ that is either $k$-reducible, D-reducible or C-reducible in $G$.
\end{theorem}

From this theorem, a 4-coloring of a planar graph $G_0$ can be found as follows. This is the same procedure that we used for the vertex of $\deg(v)\leq 5$ in the five color theorem.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find a reducible configuration $C_n$ in $G_n$.
    \item Reduce the graph $G_n$ to the smaller graph $G_{n+1}$.
    \item If $G_{n+1}$ is the empty graph, color all the intermediate graphs starting from $G_n$ all the way until $G_0$, else, repeat Step 1 on $G_{n+1}$.
\end{enumerate}
