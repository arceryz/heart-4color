The four color theorem was initially formulated from a problem in coloring world maps. A map consists of regions that can border other regions on a flat surface. When we talk about a \textit{coloring} of a map, we mean a way to color its regions such that any two neighbors are colored differently.

The actual shape of the regions in our map is not of importance here. The key information that is needed from a map, is the connectivity between regions. Such information can be represented in a \textit{graph} where vertices (circles) correspond to regions. An edge between two vertices then indicates that the two corresponding regions are neighbors.

From now on, we will leave the notion of maps and regions behind us and work solely with graphs. When we speak of a coloring, we will generally be working with letters like $abcd$ to indicate the colors on the ring. The order of these colors is indicated by the $\gg$ edge, which is the first edge between the first two vertices. We will also consider two such colorings to be \textit{equal} if they differ only by a renaming of colors.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:coleq}
    Two colorings $x$ and $y$ are \emph{equal} if they differ only by a renaming of the colors $a,b,c$ and $d$. I.e $abab = acac$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Every planar graph can be colored in at most four colors.
\end{theorem}

With \textit{planar graph} we mean a graph derived from a map as in the first two graphs on the left of Figure \ref{fig:colortut}. Edges are not allowed to cross each other. The proof of this theorem required over a 100 years to complete, despite its simple statement. What would you do to prove such a statement? A first step to the proof is to work with an easier problem instead. This is the five color theorem.
