\subsection{Ring configurations}

We have now seen that rings with nothing on their interior are already reducible. The natural next step would be to consider rings with an interior $\core$ called a \textit{core}. These will be called \textit{ring configurations}, since they are configurations with a ring as their boundary. All configurations used in the four color theorem are ring configurations!

\begin{definition}
    A planar graph $\confg = R_n + \core$ consisting of a ring $R_n$ and a \emph{core} $\core$ is called a \emph{ring configuration} on $R_n$.
\end{definition}

\end{figure}

If a ring configuration $\confg$ on $R$ is contained in a graph $G$, then the ring $R$ acts as border between the interior $\core$ and exterior $M$. Suppose that we removed from $G$ the interior $\core$ of $\confg$ to obtain the graph $M+R$. If we colored $M+R$ and $\confg$ individually, then we could add the interior $\core$ back if the two colorings have the same colors on the ring $R$. This is the essence of $k$-reducibility. We prove that such a \textit{common ring coloring} can always be found. Mathematically, we phrase this as 

\begin{equation}
    \Phi(\confg) \;\cap\; \Phi(M+R) \quad \neq \quad\varnothing.
\end{equation}

I.e, the sets of possible ring colorings of $R$ in $\confg$ and $M+R$ have a common element. Given a configuration $\confg$, we can question whether such a common element exists for all graphs $M + \confg$. To answer this question, we must know to \textit{some} degree which colorings exist in $\Phi(M+R)$. Such colorings we  call \textit{guaranteed colorings}. They are all we can work with if the graph $M$ is arbitrary.
