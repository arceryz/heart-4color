\section{Ring Reducibility}
\label{sec:birkhoff}

Before 1913, the only known reductions of maps we're the reductions to triangulations and the reduction of multiply-connected regions to fewer regions (holed regions). In 1913, Birkhoff \cite{birkhoff} proved a new reduction result for \textit{rings} that seperate two parts of a map. This result spurred new developments in the reduction of graphs that opened the path towards reducible configurations and finally the proof of Appel and Haken in 1976.

\subsection{Rings and chains}

We will use the term \textit{map} to refer to a map of connected \textit{regions} that we wish to four-color. From such a map we can construct a \textit{planar graph} where each region represents a vertex. We will be working with planar graphs in all our proofs, but might sometimes mention maps for intuition.

We have the following well-known reduction to triangulations.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:triang}
    Given a planar graph $G$ with a non-triangular bounded face. Then the coloring of $G$ can be reduced to a graph on $H$ less vertices.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    A non-triangular bounded face of $G$ corresponds to a cycle of size greater than three in $G$. Combine any two non-neighboring vertices in this cycle to form a graph on one less vertex $H$. Given a coloring of $H$, we may color the two contracted vertices the same to obtain a coloring of $G$.
\end{proof}

Let us now define rings.

\begin{definition}
    A ring of $n$ vertices $R_n$ in a planar graph $G$ is an induced cycle of $G$ that encloses at least one vertex.
\end{definition}

The key property of rings is that they seperate the full graph $G$ in three parts $M_1$, $R$ and $M_2$. That is, $G$ is of the form $G = M_1 + R + M_2$ where the order of addition indicates how each part is connected to the other.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[fill=white] (0,0) circle (2.5cm);
        \draw[fill opacity=0.4, pattern=crosshatch] (0,0) circle (1.5cm);
        \draw[fill=white] (0,0) circle (1cm);
        \node at (0, 1.25) {$R$};
        \node at (0, 2) {$M_2$};
        \node at (0, 0) {$M_1$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The graph $M_1 + R + M_2$.}
\end{figure}

To reduce a ring like this, we ideally want to color $M_1+R$ and $M_2+R$ in such a way that the colors on $R$ are the same. Then we can glue the two colorings together to form a coloring of $G$.

It might however, not always be possible to reduce a graph with a ring $R$ to $M_1+R$ and $M_2+R$. For a weaker result, we may try reducing to slightly larger subgraphs, $M_1+R+A_1$ and $M_2+R+A_2$ where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are two arbitrary subgraphs of at most $k$ vertices. 

This is a weaker result, because if we allow $k$ to be big enough, we can simply set $A_1 = M_2$ and $A_2 = M_1$ to reduce to twice $M_1 + R + M_2$, which obviously has a common coloring on the ring. Let us define this generalization of ring reducibility.

\begin{definition}
    A ring $R_n$ is said to be k-reducible if for all planar graphs $G$ containing the ring $R_n$, the coloring of $G$ can be reduced to the coloring of $M_1+R_n+A_1$ and $M_1+R_n+A_2$ with $A_1$ and $A_2$ two arbitrary planar graphs on at most $k$ vertices that are fully connected to $R_n$.
\end{definition}

For example, the following is a trivial result.

\begin{example}
    The rings $R_1, R_2$ and $R_3$ are 0-reducible.
\end{example}

\begin{proof}
    The colorings only possible colorings on these rings (up to permutation) are $\{ a \}, \{ ab \}$ and $\{ abc \}$. Given a coloring of $M_1+R$ and $M_2+R$, we can simply permute the colors in both graphs to make the colorings agree on the ring. Hence we have 0-reducibility.
\end{proof}

Starting from the ring $R_4$, we briefly introduce two concepts to make the proof easier to follow. The first are Kempe-chains first introduced by Alfred Kempe.
\begin{definition}
    Given two colors $a,b$ and a coloring of a planar graph $G$. The $ab$-chain of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is the induced subgraph of $v$ and all vertices colored $a,b$ that are connected to $v$ directly or through other vertices colored $a,b$.
\end{definition}

In addition, we introduce a notation for writing down the colors on a ring $R$ and any chains that connect two vertices of the ring. We call these \emph{ring schemes}.

\end{figure}

We will now use the concepts of chains and ring schemes to prove that the ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible and the ring $R_5$ 1-reducible.

\subsection{The ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible}

In this section we will prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
    The ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

Let us consider the possible ring colorings I and II of the graphs $M_1+R_4$ and $M_2+R_4$. Since the ring in this case is a 4-cycle, we may color two of its vertices the same by Theorem \ref{thm:triang}. We can merge either $v_1$ and $v_3$ or $v_2$ and $v_4$ to obtain the colorings $a{*}a{*}$ and ${*}a{*}a$, where the ${*}$-vary per coloring.

If any of these two colorings in I and II are equal (up to permutation), we are done. Otherwise, we may assume that

\begin{equation}
    \text{I} = \{ abab \}\quad \text{and} \quad \text{II} = \{ abac, baca \}.
\end{equation}

Now suppose that there is an $ad$-chain between $v_1$ and $v_3$ in $I(abab)$. We are allowed to flip the $bc$-chain of $v_4$ without affecting $v_2$ because the $ad$-chain in complementary colors seperates them. Thus we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \text{I}(abab) \cong \scheme{a,b,a,b}{13d} \cong \text{II}(abac)
\end{equation}

If there is no such $ad$-chain between $v_1$ and $v_3$, then likewise we are allowed to flip the $ad$-chain of $v_3$ without affecting $v_1$ to obtain

\begin{equation}
    \text{I}(abab) \cong \text{I}(abcb) \cong \text{II}(baca).
\end{equation}

In any case, we obtain a common coloring between I and II. Therefore the ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The ring $R_5$ is 1-reducible}

A know result is that every planar graph has a vertex $v$ of degree at most 5. If we apply the reduction to triangulations, this means that the five vertices surrounding $v$ form the ring $R_5$. If $R_5$ we're 0-reducible, then every planar graph would be reducible and as a consequence, no minimal counterexamples could exist to the four color theorem.

This is an intuition as to why it might be hard to prove that $R_5$ is 0-reducible (we have tried). Instead we will prove the weaker 1-reducibility, this will turn out to be sufficient for subsequent work on the four color theorem.

\begin{theorem}
    The ring $R_5$ is 1-reducible.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}Let us consider the possible ring colorings I and II of $M_1 + R_5 + A_1$ and $M_2 + R_5 + A_2$. We must now take into account the graphs $A_1$ and $A_2$ on at most one vertex. The colorings depend on the amount of vertices in $A$

\emph{$A$ has one vertex}. In this case we have the sole vertex of $A$ connected to all vertices of the ring by definition. Because we assume four-colorability, the ring can only contain three colors and hence must be colored one of $\underline{c}abab$ where the vertex colored $\underline{c}$ is free to be any of the five vertices.

\emph{$A$ is empty}. In this case we have no vertices on the other side of the ring $R_5$. Because it is a 5-cycle, we may apply Theorem \ref{thm:triang} to merge any two opposing vertices thus coloring them the same. This results in five different colorings of the form $a{*}{*}a{*}$ where any two non-adjacent vertices may be colored $a$.

Therefore we assume the following colorings for I and II:

\begin{equation}
    \text{I, II}, = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
        \text{one of}\;\underline{c}abab \; \text{with $c$ free}, \\
        \text{all of}\;a{*}{*}a{*} \; \text{with $a$  non-adjacent}
    \end{matrix}\right\}.
\end{equation}

Now we will prove that for these two sets, we can always deduce a common coloring on the ring $R_5$. To this end, we will prove two lemma's.

Let a vertex colored uniquely in one of $\underline{c}abab$ be called the \emph{marked vertex}, indicated by an underlined color. Let two colorings be called \emph{adjacent} if their marked vertices are adjacent.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:r5_first}
    If I and II have a non-adjacent coloring, then they either have an adjacent coloring or a common coloring.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:r5_second}
    If I and II have an adjacent coloring, then they have a common coloring.
\end{lemma}

\emph{Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:r5_first}}.
Let two non-adjacent colorings $\text{I}(\underline{c}abab)$ and $\text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab)$ be given. Suppose that a $bc$-chain connects $v_3$ and $v_5$ in $\text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab)$. Then we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abcab}
    \text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab) \cong \scheme{a,b,c,a,b}{35} \cong \text{II}(abcdb).
\end{equation}

If no such chain exists, then we may flip the $bc$-chain of $v_3$ to obtain

\begin{equation}
    \text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab) \cong \text{II}(a\underline{c}bab) \;\; \text{adjacent to} \;\; \text{I}(\underline{c}abab).
\end{equation}

Now to deal with the former coloring, we consider the coloring $\text{I}({*}b{*}{*}b)$. The three unique possibilities for the colors lead to

\begin{equation}
    \begin{matrix*}[l]
        \text{I}(abcdb) \quad\quad\cong&\text{II}(abcdb) \; \text{from (\ref{eq:abcab}),}  \\
        \text{I}(cbc\underline{d}b) \;\; \text{adjacent to}&\text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab), \;  \\
        \text{I}(db\underline{c}db) \quad\quad\cong&\text{II}(ab\underline{c}ab).
    \end{matrix*}
\end{equation}

A similar argument holds for any other pair of non-adjacent colorings for I and II. Therefore we obtain either a common coloring or an adjacent coloring. These adjacent colorings are then treated by the second lemma $\qedsymbol$.

\vspace{1em}
\emph{Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:r5_second}}

Let two adjacent colorings $\text{I}(\underline{c}abab)$ and $\text{II}(a\underline{c}bab)$ be given. Suppose a $bd$-chain connects $v_3$ and $v_5$ in $\text{II}(a\underline{c}bab)$. Then we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \text{II}(a\underline{c}bab) \cong \scheme{a,c,b,a,b}{35d} \cong \text{I}(\underline{c}abab).
\end{equation}

If no such chain exists, then we may flip the $bd$-chain of $v_3$ to obtain

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acdab}
    \text{II}(a\underline{c}bab) \cong \text{II}(acdab).
\end{equation}

Now we consider the coloring $\text{I}(a{*}{*}a{*})$. The three unique possibilities for the colors lead to

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{matrix*}[l]
        \text{I}(acdab) \quad\cong& \text{II}(acdab), \;\text{from (\ref{eq:acdab})},\\
        \text{I}(ac\underline{d}ac) \; &\text{shifted two to right of $\text{I}(\underline{c}abab)$}, \\
        \text{I}(a\underline{c}dad) \quad\cong& \text{II}(a\underline{c}bab).
    \end{matrix*}
\end{equation*}

By following this procedure, we end up with either a common coloring, or a coloring that is shifted two to the right.

We can repeat this procedure again with $\text{II}(a\underline{c}bab)$ and $\text{I}(ac\underline{d}ac)$, to obtain $\text{II}(aba\underline{c}b)$. Another repetition yields another shifted coloring for I. Hence we obtain the pattern

\begin{equation}
    \text{I}(\underline{c}abab) \rightarrow \text{I}(ab\underline{c}ab) \rightarrow \text{I}(abab\underline{c}) \rightarrow \text{I}(a\underline{c}bab) \cong \text{II}(a\underline{c}bab).
\end{equation}

A similar argument holds for any pair of adjacent colorings of I and II. Therefore, in all cases, we obtain a common coloring $\qedsymbol$.

\vspace{1em}
If the marked vertices are the same, we can simply permute colors to obtain a common coloring of I and II. Together with these two lemma's we will have covered all cases of marked vertices. Therefore the ring $R_5$ is 1-reducible.

\end{proof}
