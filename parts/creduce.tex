\section{C-Reducibility}
\label{sec:creduce}

While an ideal proof of the four-color theorem would use an unavoidable set of only D-reducible configurations, in practice, finding such a set would cost too much time.

Instead, a second, stronger form of reducibility was used in conjunction with D-reducibility. This is C-reducibility.

Recall that D-reducibility required that all possible ring colorings $\Phi(n)$ are in the implying set $\overline{\Phi}(C)$. If a configuration is not D-reducible, then there must be ring colorings in $\Phi(n)$ that are not in $\overline{\Phi}(C)$. These colorings can not be converted to coloring of $C$ with chain flips. It is these colorings of the set $\Phi(n) \setminus \overline{\Phi}(C)$ that we want to avoid with C-reducibility. 

We will avoid this set by replacing $C$ with a reducer $(S,\sigma)$ consisting of a smaller graph $S$ and a ring contraction $\sigma$. The un-contracted ring colorings of $(S,\sigma)$ denoted by $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ we then require to be contained in $\overline{\Phi}(C)$.

        \node at (0.9, -0.6) { $\Phi_0(C)$ };
        \node at (0.3, 0.35) { $\overline{\Phi}(C)$ };
        \node at (0, 1.35) { $\Phi(n)$ };
        \node at (-0.8, -0.4) { $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ };
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \label{fig:cred}
\end{figure}

Therefore, C-reducibility can be seen as an extension of D-reducibility with the reducer $(S, \sigma)$ acting as a "filter" of ring colorings. This way we can ignore those ring colorings that are not in $\overline{\Phi}(C)$. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:cred}, there are still colorings for the ring that are not in $\overline{\Phi}(C)$. However, we avoid them using the colorings of the reducer, $\Phi(S, \sigma)$.

Let us start with the definition of a ring contraction.

\begin{definition}
    A ring contraction $\sigma(v)$ is a map from the vertices of a ring $R$ to the contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$. We require
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$ is a valid planar graph.
        \item Neighboring ring vertices $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ are not contracted.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Ring contractions allows the reducer to shrink the number of boundary vertices. This makes simplifies the coloring problem for the reducer. Without a ring contraction, our reducer would still have the same ring as our configuration $C$, making it equally difficult to work with. Why do we not simply delete vertices from the ring of $C$? The contraction allows us to translate boundary colorings of $(S,\sigma)$ to ring colorings of $C$ simply by un-contracting.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:contract} shows the contraction process on $R_5$. Intuitively, you should think of a contraction as a merging of the two endpoints of an edge. However, mathematically, it is easier to work with mapping function $\sigma$ instead. This allows us to easily translate colorings from the reducer to the configuration, without worrying about the edges.

Suppose we are given a coloring $x(v)$ of a contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$. Then the composition $x \circ \sigma(v)$ is a valid coloring for $R$. This process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:contractcolor}

By introducing ring contractions, we have already treated the largest portion of a reducer. The last part is the extra graph $S$. This graph defines the interior of our contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$. This is similar to how we used an auxiliary graph $A$ during the 1-reducibility proof of $R_5$. The boundary vertices of $S$ must be the same as the contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$. Therefore we can now define the reducer.

\begin{definition}
    A reducer of a configuration $C$ is a pair $(S, \sigma)$  consisting of a ring contraction $\sigma$ and a graph $S$ on less vertices than $C$ that has a boundary equal to the contracted ring $\sigma \circ R$.
\end{definition}

Of course, every reducer will reduce the size of a configuration $C$. However, for actual reducibility, we can not simply take any reducer. Our reducer $(S, \sigma)$ must satisfy the "filtering" property mentioned at the beginning of this section. That is, its colorings $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ must be contained in $\overline{\Phi}(C)$. Let us first define the set of un-contracted ring colorings $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ derived from the contracted ring colorings of $(S, \sigma)$.

\begin{definition}
    Let $(S, \sigma)$ be a reducer. The set of un-contracted ring colorings $\Phi(S, \sigma)$ consists of all the colorings $x \circ \sigma(v)$ with $x(v)$ a boundary coloring of $S$.
\end{definition}
