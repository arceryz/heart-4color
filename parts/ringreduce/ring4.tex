\subsection{0-reducibility of the ring $R_4$}

We will show that all configurations on the ring $R_4$ are reducible without the need for a reducer. This proof and the proof of the five color theorem are very much alike.

\begin{theorem}
    The ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

Let the planar graph $M+\confg$ with configuration $\confg = \core + R_4$ be arbitrary. Since we set $k=0$, we will try reducing to $M+R_4$ and $\confg$. For convenience, let the possible ring colorings of these two reductions be represented by the sets

\begin{equation}
    \I = \Phi(M+R_4) \quad \text{and} \quad \II = \Phi(\confg).
\end{equation}

To gain an insight into the possible colorings of these sets, we sketched the situation in Figure \ref{fig:ring4tut}.

    \caption{The reductions $M+R_4$ and $\core+R_4$ ($\confg$). What can we say about their possible ring colorings $\I$ and $\II$?}
    \label{fig:ring4tut}
\end{figure}

You might have noticed that both reductions contain the plain ring $R_4$ with no other vertices on one side. Therefore, as we have shown in Theorem \ref{thm:ringsarered} about plain ring reducibility, we may contract any two non-neighboring vertices to obtain further reductions.

We wont sketch these contracted graphs here, but in the context of ring colorings in $\I$ and $\II$, we will obtain colorings of $R_4$ with two contracted vertices colored the same. Because there are two ways to contract vertices on $R_4$ (the two diagonals), we are guaranteed of the following two colorings in $\I$ and $\II$.

\begin{equation}
    \left\{\begin{matrix}
        abab \;\;\text{or}\;\; abac, \\
        baba \;\;\text{or}\;\; baca
    \end{matrix}\right\} \subset I,II.
\end{equation}

Let us evaluate every pair of possibilities to see if there is a common coloring. First note that $abab=baba$ by definition of equality between ring colorings (Definition \ref{def:coleq}). Then, there remain 3 possible sets for $\I$ and $\II$.

\needspace{2cm}
\begin{equation}
    \circled{1} = \{ abab \}, \quad \circled{2} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}abab \\ baca\end{matrix} \right\}, \quad \circled{3} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}abac \\ baca \end{matrix} \right\}.
\end{equation}

You might already see that there is only one pair where we must actually show something, because
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\I = \circled{1}$ and $\II = \circled{2}$ implies that $abab$ is the common coloring.
    \item $\I = \circled{2}$ and $\II = \circled{3}$ implies that $baca$ is the common coloring.
    \item $\I = \circled{1}$ and $\II = \circled{3}$. This is where Kempe-chains come in.
\end{enumerate}

To handle the third case, let $\I = \{ abab \}$ and $\II = \{ abac, baca \}$. Similar to what we did with the five color theorem, suppose that in the coloring $\I(abab)$ we have $\chain{v_1}{v_3}{ad}$. In both cases we obtain

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \I(abab) &= \scheme{a,b,a,b}{13d} \compat \II(abac) \\
        \I(abab) &= \scheme{a,b,a,b}{13d-} \compat \I(abcb) = \II(baca).
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In any case, we obtain a common ring coloring between $\I$ and $\II$. Therefore the ring $R_4$ is 0-reducible.
\end{proof}
